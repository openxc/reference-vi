<h2>What is OpenXC?</h2>

[OpenXC][openxc] is an API to your car - by installing a small hardware module
to read and translate metrics from a car's internal network, the data becomes
accessible from most Android applications using the OpenXC library. You can
start making vehicle-aware applications that have better interfaces based on
context, can minimize distraction while driving, are integrated with other
connected services, and can offer you more insight into your car's operation.
This website is the documentation for a reference design of an OpenXC-compatible
[Vehicle Interface](http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/index.html)  -
for more information on the platform in general, visit
[openxcplatform.com][openxc].

The [Vehicle Interface](http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/index.html)
(VI) is piece of hardware that connects to the car's CAN bus, translates
proprietary CAN messages to the standard [OpenXC message format][output-format]
and sends the output over a common interface like USB to a [host device][] -
this particular implementation has USB and Bluetooth.

Ford created this design and manufactured a small quantity to seed the developer
community. If you have an idea for an OpenXC application and this hardware would
help, [submit a
request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-l7_i7b6xsITh9q3Pr1NCjAU6Yw_cTPEgrPCNCggQec/viewform)
to receive one of these prototypes. Make sure there aren't [any known issues
with
fit](https://github.com/openxc/openxcplatform.com/wiki/Vehicle-interface-physical-fit-compatibility)
for the reference VI in your car.

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<div class="tabbable">
  <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a href="#app-devs" data-toggle="tab">For App Developers</a></li>
    <li><a href="#firmware-devs" data-toggle="tab">For Firmware Developers</a></li>
    <li><a href="#hardware-devs" data-toggle="tab">For Hardware Developers</a></li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tab-content">
    <div class="active tab-pane" id="app-devs">

      <p>The VI needs to be programmed with firmware before you can get data
      from a car. You can use the <a
      href="https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware/releases">emulator
      firmware (zip file)</a> to test the data connection to a <a
      href="http://openxcplatform.com/host-devices/index.html">host device</a>
      (a computer, smartphone or tablet). To get data from a real car, grab one
      of the <a
      href="http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/firmware.html">other
      available firmwares</a>.</p>

      <p>Once you've downloaded a firmware file (it should be a version for the
      "FORDBOARD" and have the ".bin" extension) programming the VI is simple -
      follow the <a href="/firmware/programming/usb.html">USB programming
      instructions</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane" id="firmware-devs">

      <p>Besides using <a
      href="http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/firmware.html">binary
      firmware for app developers</a>, you can build your own code to run on the
      VI. You can use the <a
      href="http://vi-firmware.openxcplatform.com">official OpenXC VI
      firmware</a> (the source for most binary firmware, e.g. those from Ford)
      or start from scratch with a <a
      href="https://github.com/openxc/lpc17xx-starter">blank project</a>.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use one of a few lower level programming options
      (some even allow in-circuit debugging). More details are available in the
      <a href="/firmware/index.html">firmware page</a>.

      <p>This site contains complete documentation of the hardware,
      design motivations, fabrication and testing plans. Every component is
      released as open source hardware and the source files are available in the
      <a href="https://github.com/openxc/reference-vi">openxc/reference-vi</a>
      GitHub repository (along with the contents of this website).

<h2>What is this vehicle interface?</h2>

The particular unit is a reference design for a "dongle" style vehicle interface
that connects directly to the diagnostic port with no cable. Ford created this
design as an iteration from the original, [chipKIT-based vehicle
interface](http://chipkit-vi.openxcplatform.com) with the goal to:

* Require no OBD-II cable to connect to the vehicle
* Be compact enough to sit directly on the OBD-II port and not hit the driver's
  knees.
* Include Bluetooth by default
* Be powered from the vehicle and not drain the battery when left attached
* Provide 12v power from the vehicle to an external USB hub for other OpenXC
  hardware modules

This streamlined vehicle interface uses a ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller (NXP's
LPC1769), a dual-channel CAN transceiver from NXP, the RN-41 Bluetooth
module from Roving
Networks and includes a micro-USB port. The design also includes a 12v port
(with a Molex connector) to power an external device from the car, and this port
can be shut off with the car to avoid battery drain.

We also designed and prototyped a plastic housing for the board that allows it
to be easily gripped and attached/detached from the OBD-II port underneath the
steering wheel.

The device is not as compact as it could be, primarily because we design it to
use only a 2-layer PCB (to make it more accessible for hobbyists). Depending on
the placement and angle of the OBD-II port in your vehicle, the VI may protrude
too much - we recommend one of the many available [OBD-II extension
cables](http://www.obd2cables.com/products/obd-cables/obd-ii-cables/cable-j1962m-to-j1962f-obd-ii-extension-cable-5ft.html)
if that's the case.

The current BOM total cost for the electrical components in 1,000 unit
quantities is around $45.


### Features

* Reads from 2 different CAN buses simultaneously at up to 1Mbps per bus - by
  default CAN1 and CAN2-1 (according to the [OpenXC naming
  scheme](http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/index.html)), with CAN2-2
  available behind a solder jumper
* Can relay vehicle data at up to 250kbps over a Bluetooth connection
* Can relay vehicle data at up to 11Mbps over a USB connection
* Passes up to 6A of power from the vehicle to accessories
